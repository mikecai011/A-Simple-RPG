# Grade-11-ICS-Culminating--in-Processing-
A simple RPG made for Grade 11 ICS culminating

This program was co-created by Michael Cai and James Bao.
It is used for Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science course culminating project.
For all files in "Data" folder, we ONLY hold rights to "william.png". It was created using RPG Maker VX Ace.
All characters' images were created by fellow schoolmates in Visual Art classes in John Fraser Secondary School.


In this project:
James solely created the original Fighting Scene section of the game
I solely created the original World Explore, menu, key functionality, and screen enumerator
However, all parts were cross-examinated, and corrections were made by both of us in all files.



The following images were obtained from internet and are cited:
"Dark Room0001"
"Arena"
"Key"
"map01"
"Menu Background"
"Start Button"
"Furui Ningyou"
***note: "map01_collision.png" was edited by me from the original image "map01.png". I added all map restriction lines in red colour.
